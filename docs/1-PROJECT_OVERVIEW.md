# HEAL Salone - Project Overview

## 1. Problem Statement

### Simple Version

Sierra Leone faces significant health challenges, including maternal emergencies and disease outbreaks (like Cholera), often worsened by slow reporting and lack of real-time data. Communities need a way to speak up, and authorities need a way to listen and act fast.

### Technical Version

The current public health surveillance infrastructure in Sierra Leone suffers from high latency in data collection, unstructured reporting channels, and a lack of centralized, actionable analytics. This fragmentation leads to delayed response times for critical health events (maternal mortality, infectious disease vectors) and prevents data-driven resource allocation by the Ministry of Health.

### Hackathon-Ready Version

**"The Silence of Lag:"** In a medical emergency, latency kills. HEAL Salone solves the "last-mile" information gap in Sierra Leone’s healthcare system. By bridging low-tech community reporting (SMS/Web) with high-tech AI analysis, we replace weeks of paper-based delays with sub-second real-time intelligence, empowering the Ministry of Health to stop outbreaks before they become epidemics.

## 2. Solution Overview

**HEAL Salone** (Health Emergency AI Line) is a civic-tech platform designed to democratize health reporting and optimize government response.

### Key Features

- **Crowdsourced Health Reporting:** A simple, intuitive interface (Web & Mobile) for citizens to report symptoms, unsafe water, or localized outbreaks.
- **AI Triage Assistant:** An integrated LLM-powered assistant (OpenAI) that guides users through symptom checking, provides immediate first-aid advice in local context, and categorizes report severity.
- **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard:** A "Mission Control" for the Ministry of Health/Admins to visualize hotspots on a map, track infection trends, and allocate resources efficiently.
- **Local Language Support:** Interface and AI interactions designed to be accessible (English/Krio context).
- **Government Integration:** Exports standardized data formats compatible with existing Ministry of Health DHIS2 systems.

| **Inputs**           | - Mobile-first Web Platform<br>- AI Triage Algorithms<br>- Community Youth Reporters<br>- Partnership with Ministry of Health                                               |
| **Activities**       | - Citizens report distinct health events.<br>- AI validates and categorizes data.<br>- Dashboard aggregates data for officials.                                             |
| **Outputs**          | - Reduced time-to-report (from days to seconds).<br>- Heatmaps of disease vectors.<br>- Validated data streams for decision makers.                                         |
| **Outcomes**         | - Faster ambulance/response deployment.<br>- Early detection of Cholera/Ebola vectors.<br>- Increased public trust in health systems.                                       |
| **Long-term Impact** | A resilient, responsive national health network that significantly reduces maternal mortality rates and prevents large-scale epidemics through proactive data intelligence. |

# HEAL Salone - 60 Second Demo Script

**(0:00 - 0:10) The Problem**
"In Sierra Leone, it takes an average of 3 days for a paper health report to reach the Ministry. In a Cholera outbreak, 3 days is a death sentence. We asked: Why can we send a WhatsApp instantly, but not a health alert?"

**(0:10 - 0:25) The Solution (Showing Dashboard/Login)**
"Introducing HEAL Salone. The first AI-powered health bridge. I'm logging in now as a citizen reporter in Makeni. I see a pile of uncollected refuse near a water source. I click 'Report'."

**(0:25 - 0:35) AI Assistant**
"But what if I'm sick? I switch to the AI Assistant. 'I have a high fever and headache.' The AI instantly triages this, suggesting Malaria protocols and directing me to the nearest clinic, unburdening the hospital lines."

**(0:35 - 0:50) The Impact (Admin View)**
"Instantly, in Freetown, the Ministry Dashboard lights up. We see the refuse report and the fever spike on the heatmap. Resources are dispatched in minutes, not days."

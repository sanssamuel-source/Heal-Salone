# HEAL Salone - Pitch Deck Content (10 Slides)

## Slide 1: Title

- **Project Name:** HEAL Salone
- **Tagline:** Bridging the Gap Between Emergency and Response.
- **Team:* [Samuel, Tonny and Zara sansconstruction16@gmail.com +23279093505]*
- **Event:** ChristEX Civic Hackathon 2025

## Slide 2: The Problem

- **Latency Kills:** Health reporting in Sierra Leone operates on paper speed (days/weeks).
- **The Gap:** Citizens have mobile phones, but no direct line to health authorities.
- **The Result:** Preventable outbreaks (Cholera) and maternal deaths occur due to delayed information.

## Slide 3: Why It Matters

- **Maternal Mortality:** Sierra Leone has one of the highest rates globally.
- **Public Trust:** Citizens feel unheard when infrastructure fails.
- **Data Sovereignty:** We need local data for local decisions.

## Slide 4: Our Solution

- **HEAL Salone Platform:** A Full-Stack Civic Tech ecosystem.
  1.  **Citizen App:** For instant reporting & AI advice.
  2.  **Admin Command Center:** For real-time government visualization.
  3.  **AI Layer:** For instant triage and data categorization.

## 🛑 Script 1: The Pitch (Intro)

**Target Length:** 60 Seconds
**Avatar Tone:** Passionate, Urgent, Inspiring.
**Visuals:** Stock footage of Sierra Leone, busy markets, rural clinics, mobile phones.

**[0:00]**
"Did you know that in a medical emergency, the biggest killer isn't the disease itself... it's the silence?"

**[0:08]**
"In Sierra Leone, it can take days for a paper health report to travel from a rural village to the Ministry in Freetown. By the time it arrives, an outbreak has already spread."

**[0:18]**
"Enter HEAL Salone."

**[0:21]**
"We are bridging that gap. We are replacing days of travel, with seconds of data."

**[0:26]**
"HEAL Salone is a civic-tech platform that turns every mobile phone into a life-saving tool. Any mother, nurse, or student can now report a hazard, get immediate AI medical advice, and alert authorities instantly."

**[0:40]**
"We are closing the loop between the people who need help, and the government that provides it."

**[0:48]**
"This isn't just an app. It is a national survival network."

**[0:53]**
"Let's stop the lag. Let's HEAL Salone."

## ⚙️ Script 2: Technical Deep Dive

**Target Length:** 90 Seconds
**Avatar Tone:** Professional, Knowledgeable, Clear.
**Visuals:** Screen recordings of the App, Code snippets, Architecture diagrams (React/Node/Postgres logos).

**[0:00]**
"Let's look under the hood of HEAL Salone. We built this platform with three engineering pillars: Speed, Accessibility, and Resilience."

**[0:10]**
"For the **Frontend**, we chose **React with Vite**. It is incredibly lightweight, which is critical for the low-bandwidth 3G networks we often face in the provinces. We used **TailwindCSS** to design a responsive UI that works on any device, from cheap smartphones to government tablets."

**[0:30]**
"The **Backend** is powered by **Node.js and Express**, currently hosted on **Railway**. It is designed to be stateless and scalable."

**[0:40]**
"We manage our data with **Prisma ORM** connected to a **PostgreSQL** database. This relational model is crucial because it allows us to perform complex geospatial queries—turning raw reports into the heatmaps you see on the dashboard."

**[0:55]**
"But the real innovation is our **AI Layer**. We integrated the **OpenAI API** to act as a first-line triage unit. It parses natural language, filters out noise, and categorizes emergencies before they even reach a human administrator."

**[1:10]**
"Finally, we handle connectivity issues with a **Vercel Proxy architecture**, ensuring that even if network conditions are strict, our data finds a way through."

**[1:20]**
"This is full-stack engineering, applied to real human survival. Thank you."
